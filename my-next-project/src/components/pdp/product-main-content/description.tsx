                  and a vintage-inspired sound. This guitar, featuring a solid torrefied Sitka spruce top and solid
                  Honduran rosewood back and sides, delivers a warm, rich tone with exceptional clarity, projection and
                  sustain. Whether you're a seasoned professional or a passionate enthusiast, the 814e is ready to

                <h3>Super Auditorium Body Shape—A New Era of Acoustic Design</h3>
                <p>
                  The 814e introduces Taylor's new Super Auditorium body shape, a refined take on the classic Grand
                  Auditorium design. This body style offers a slightly longer body and a wider lower bout, resulting in
                  a "classically proportioned set of curves" that delivers a balanced and resonant tone with a focused
                  midrange. The Super Auditorium shape is ideal for a variety of playing styles and musical genres, from
                  delicate fingerpicking to powerful strumming.

                <h3>Fanned V-Class Bracing—Unleashing the Guitar's Sonic Potential</h3>
                <p>
                  This acoustic-electric guitar features Taylor's innovative Fanned V-Class bracing, a new variation on
                  their revolutionary V-Class bracing system. This bracing pattern features a fan-like arrangement of
                  braces in the soundboard's lower bout, enhancing the guitar's midrange frequencies and low-end girth.
                  The Fanned V-Class bracing also retains the benefits of traditional V-Class bracing, including
                  improved volume, sustain, responsiveness and pitch accuracy.

                <h3>Premium Tonewoods—A Symphony of Warmth and Clarity</h3>
                <p>
                  The 814e is crafted with a solid torrefied Sitka spruce top, a process that enhances the wood's
                  resonance and produces a warm, aged tone with exceptional clarity. The solid Honduran rosewood back
                  and sides complement the spruce top, adding depth, complexity and a touch of vintage warmth to the
                  guitar's voice. This combination of premium tonewoods creates a versatile instrument that's capable of
                  handling a wide range of musical styles and techniques.

                <h3>L.R. Baggs Element VTC Electronics—Amplifying Your Acoustic Voice</h3>

                  is as rich and expressive as your acoustic sound. This high-quality pickup system captures the nuances
                  of your playing with exceptional clarity and detail, delivering a natural and balanced amplified tone

                <h3>Exquisite Appointments—Elegance in Every Detail</h3>
                <p>
                  The 814e is adorned with exquisite appointments that enhance its aesthetic appeal and contribute to
                  its exceptional tone. The genuine West African ebony fingerboard and bridge provide a smooth and
                  responsive playing surface, while the Micarta saddle and TUSQ nut ensure optimal intonation and
                  sustain. The guitar's natural gloss finish highlights the beauty of the tonewoods, while the Gotoh 510
                  Antique Gold tuners with ebony buttons add a touch of elegance. The 814e also includes a Taylor Deluxe
                  hardshell case with a "British Cocoa Bronco" vinyl exterior for safe and stylish transport.
